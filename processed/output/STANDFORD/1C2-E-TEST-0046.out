1C2-E-TEST-0046-5.3	Hayes was a congressman and Governor of Ohio before becoming a "dark horse" Republican candidate for President in 1876.ÃÂÃÂ  Running against Democrat Samuel J. Tilden, Hayes lost the popular vote but won the Presidency by one vote in the Electoral College, the closest Presidential election in history except in 1824, when John Quincy Adams received fewer electoral votes than his opponent but was elected in the House of Representatives, and in 2000, when George W. Bush narrowly won over over Albert Gore.ÃÂÃÂ  Some people accused Hayes of "stealing" the election, but he turned out to be so honest and hardworking that both his own party and the Democrats respected him.ÃÂÃÂ  His Vice President was William A. Wheeler.

1C2-E-TEST-0065-124.11	"Steelers Mimic of Aaron Rodgers Championship Belt Celebration During Game: In case you aren aware of Aarons trademark celebration, you can see a clip here .I think its pretty awesome.Some players on opposing teams have imitated this celebration on occasion (for instance, when Rodgers is sacked), which leads to this prop bet.I dont think there will be much reason for anyone on the Steelers to be doing this tomorrow, which is why Im taking the big no on this one. This concludes my proposition analysis and leads me to my actual pick for the game:"

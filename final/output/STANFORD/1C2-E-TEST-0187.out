1C2-E-TEST-0187-130.16	"However, there is still a large spectral region between 500 and 600 nm where chlorophyll absorbs very little light, and plants appear green because this light is reflected."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-130.43	"It channels the energy of sunlight into chemical energy, converting it through the process of photosynthesis."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-130.44	"In photosynthesis, chlorophyll absorbs energy to transform carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-130.6	Chlorophyll absorbs certain wavelengths of light within the visible light spectrum.
1C2-E-TEST-0187-130.7	"As shown in detail in the absorption spectra, chlorophyll absorbs light in the red (long wavelength) and the blue (short wavelength) regions of the visible light spectrum."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-130.8	"Green light is not absorbed but reflected, making the plant appear green."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-147.153	"Or, is it because they absorb every color except green light?"
1C2-E-TEST-0187-18.14	"The wavelength of the reflected light determines which color we see; red is the longest reflected wavelength, and violet is the shortest reflected wavelength."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-18.15	"So, we can determine that leaves are green because they reflect light in the green spectrum, namely about 560 to 490 nanometers."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-18.17	"But that only tells us why leaves appear green, not why they reflect that particular wavelength in the first place."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-195.16	" Because chlorophyll absorb the wavelengths of visible light ( violet-blue and orange-red light) and scatter (reflect) the green light that eventually reaches our eyes, chlorophylls therefore appears green in color ."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-195.19	"Carotenoids pigment gives the color yellow, orange, and brown hues."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-2.3	"The green color in leaves is caused by the presence of a compound called ""chlorophyll,"" which the plant produces to do photosynthesis, which is how plants get energy from sunlight."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-2.5	"The chlorophyll is green because it absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light -- and so green is not absorbed and is reflected, making the plant look green to your eyes."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-21.21	"Photosynthetic pigment, such as chlorophyll, will only absorb certain wavelengths of light, and it's only the wavelengths that are absorbed which can influence the photosynthetic reaction."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-21.23	" When we look at a green leaf, green is the wavelength of light that is being reflected and not absorbed."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-21.26	Blue and red light are the wavelengths absorbed by chlorophyll and used to drive photosynthesis.
1C2-E-TEST-0187-21.27	"Green light is not absorbed, it is reflected, and that is why leaves appear green."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-268.11	 Chlorophylls (cell membranes; chloroplasts): absorb red and blue wavelengths; thus the light reflected appears green to our eyes.
1C2-E-TEST-0187-268.12	"Carotene & Chlorophyll: absorb red, blue-green, and blue wavelengths; thus the light reflected appears green to our eyes."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-268.9	Carotenes (cell membranes; chloroplasts): absorb blue-green and blue wavelengths; thus the light reflected appears yellow to our eyes.
1C2-E-TEST-0187-4.4	"The green color in leaves is caused by the presence of a compound called ""chlorophyll,"" which the plant produces to do photosynthesis, which is how plants get energy from sunlight."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-4.6	"The chlorophyll is green because it absorbs red and blue wavelengths of light -- and so green is not absorbed and is reflected, making the plant look green to your eyes."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-5.12	"As they absorb all other wavelengths except green, naturally green is reflected as the only remaining unabsorbed wavelength."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-6.10	This is due to visible light absorbed by the object which part of the decision.
1C2-E-TEST-0187-80.10	The Chlorophyll cells within the plant leaves are perfectly optimized to absorb the red and blue light from the sun because this is the kind of light the plant can make use of in Photosynthesis.
1C2-E-TEST-0187-80.11	The remaining light is reflected back which makes the leaves appear green to our eyes.
1C2-E-TEST-0187-80.4	In order for something to look a particular color it must reflect that color of light to our eyes.
1C2-E-TEST-0187-80.5	"In the case of plants, this means they are reflecting only green light and are absorbing the red and blue frequencies of the light spectrum."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-80.6	"Since sunlight is made up of more red and blue light than green, this would suggest that plants absorb a lot of sunlight and are somehow optimized for this."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-86.105	"Furthermore, the green and yellow light which is not used and passes through the leaf may well be absorbed"
1C2-E-TEST-0187-86.123	pigments that absorb red light and so they reflect and transmit red light well.
1C2-E-TEST-0187-86.204	"The fact that some land plants are blue, some red, some almost black"
1C2-E-TEST-0187-86.39	Plants absorb light and use the energy of the light to make complex organic chemicals - fuels like sugar and
1C2-E-TEST-0187-86.83	Plants are green because they absorb almost all of the blue and red light and transmit and reflect almost half of the green light and the yellow light and so their leaves appear yellow-green.
1C2-E-TEST-0187-9.14	"Chlorophyll doesn't work at all in green light, and that's why plants appear to be green, because the plant leaves absorb the other colors and reflect green light back to our eyes."
1C2-E-TEST-0187-9.9	The function of chlorophyll is to absorb light from the sun and convert it into oxygen and water by the process of photosynthesis.

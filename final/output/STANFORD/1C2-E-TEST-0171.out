1C2-E-TEST-0171-4.3	IP addresses consist of a series of four numbers separated by decimal points. There are two types of IP addresses: static and dynamic. Static IP addresses remain the same and are unchanging. They are permanent and are used as easy identifiers. Dynamic IP addresses are temporary and change.

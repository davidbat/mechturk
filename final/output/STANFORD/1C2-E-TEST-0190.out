1C2-E-TEST-0190-1.10	"Since the moon rotates around the Earth and the Earth rotates around its own axis, the oceans are constantly in flux between high and low tide, which occur in intervals of about six hours and twelve minutes."
1C2-E-TEST-0190-1.13	"This is especially notable when the Earth, moon and sun line up together, which occurs twice each month -- during the full and new moons."
1C2-E-TEST-0190-1.9	High tides occur at each of these gravitationally induced bulges with low tides occurring in between.
1C2-E-TEST-0190-116.2	"The tide-generating force is produced by the combination of (1) the gravitational attraction between Earth and the moon and sun, and (2) the rotation of the Earth-moon and Earth-sun systems."

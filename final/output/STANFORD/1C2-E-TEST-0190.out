1C2-E-TEST-0190-7.25	Once in a while, a record high tide is recorded, called a spring tide that is the highest of the high tides and they generally occur during a Full Moon and New Moon.

1C2-E-TEST-0190-7.35	There is something called gravity that can never be switched off somehow and it's Moon's gravitational pull along with Sun's, that causes tides to occur.

1C2-E-TEST-0190-7.46	On a New Moon or a Full Moon, the Sun and the Moon get aligned in a straight line and their combined gravitational influence causes the highest tides ever, which are spring tides.

1C2-E-TEST-0190-86.13	This creates a high tide on the side of the earth opposite the high tide caused by the direct pull of the moon.

1C2-E-TEST-0190-86.19	Tides are most pronounced along the coastline of the oceans and in bays where tidal range (the difference in height between low tide and high tide) is increased due to the topography and other factors.

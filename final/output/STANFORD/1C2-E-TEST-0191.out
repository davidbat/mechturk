1C2-E-TEST-0191-1.10	The nuclei of these heavy elements split releasing energy and more neutrons to continue the process of splitting other nuclei.
1C2-E-TEST-0191-112.6	The most frequently used elements to produce nuclear fission are uranium and plutonium .
1C2-E-TEST-0191-168.203	"No chain reaction was produced, but the fusion neutrons had sufficient energy to cause fission of the uranium nuclei and thus added to the explosive yield and also to the radioactivity of the bomb residues."
1C2-E-TEST-0191-168.27	"In other words, energy can be released by the nuclear fission , or splitting, of a single massive nucleus into two smaller fragments."
1C2-E-TEST-0191-168.66	Nuclear energy is also released when the fission of a heavy nucleus such as
1C2-E-TEST-0191-168.69	A nuclear fission reaction releases 10 million times as much energy as is released in a typical chemical reaction.
1C2-E-TEST-0191-168.71	"The fission process initiated by the absorption of one neutron in uranium-235 releases about 2.5 neutrons, on the average, from the split nuclei."
1C2-E-TEST-0191-171.133	Pure fission weapons were the first nuclear weapons built and the only type ever used in warfare.
1C2-E-TEST-0191-171.173	Nuclear reactions Nuclear fission splits the heaviest of atoms to form lighter atoms.
1C2-E-TEST-0191-171.179	Fission can be self-sustaining because fission produces more neutrons of the speed required to cause new fissions.
1C2-E-TEST-0191-171.212	"Fission is thus necessary to start fusion, to sustain fusion, and to optimize the extraction of useful energy from fusion (by making more fission)."
1C2-E-TEST-0191-171.44	The first are weapons which produce their explosive energy through nuclear fission reactions alone.
